# Learning Python: Everything Is Object

## Overview

This project delves into fundamental concepts of Python, emphasizing object-oriented programming and memory management. The tasks aim to enhance your understanding of Python's object model and its distinctive features.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without relying on external sources:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- What is an object.
- Difference between a class and an object or instance.
- Difference between immutable and mutable objects.
- What is a reference.
- What is an assignment.
- What is an alias.
- How to determine if two variables are identical.
- How to determine if two variables are linked to the same object.
- How to display the variable identifier (memory address in the CPython implementation).
- Understanding mutable and immutable.
- Built-in mutable types.
- Built-in immutable types.
- How Python passes variables to functions.

### Copyright - Plagiarism
