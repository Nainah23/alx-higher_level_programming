Project Overview
This project includes Python scripts that focus on input and output operations. The scripts cover various topics such as reading and writing files, working with JSON data, and implementing a simple serialization and deserialization mechanism.

Project Structure
0-read_file.py: Reads a text file (UTF8) and prints its content to stdout.
1-write_file.py: Writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.
2-append_write.py: Appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.
3-to_json_string.py: Returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
4-from_json_string.py: Returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.
5-save_to_json_file.py: Writes an object to a text file using a JSON representation.
6-load_from_json_file.py: Creates an object from a JSON file.
7-add_item.py: Adds all command-line arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file in JSON format.
8-class_to_json.py: Returns the dictionary description of an object for JSON serialization.
9-student.py: Defines a Student class with public instance attributes and a method to convert the instance to a JSON representation.
10-student.py: Extends the Student class by adding a method to filter attributes for JSON representation.
11-student.py: Extends the Student class by adding methods to save and reload from a JSON file.
12-pascal_triangle.py: Generates Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists.
