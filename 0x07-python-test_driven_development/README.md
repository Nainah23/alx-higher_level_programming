Project Name: Python Test-Driven Development
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome.
What’s an interactive test.
Why tests are important.
How to write Docstrings to create tests.
How to write documentation for each module and function.
What are the basic option flags to create tests.
How to find edge cases.
Copyright - Plagiarism
Solutions for the tasks below must be created independently.
Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
All files end with a new line.
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
All files must be executable.
Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All test files should be inside a folder named tests.
All test files should be text files (extension: .txt).
All tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*.
All modules and functions should have documentation.
Documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose.
